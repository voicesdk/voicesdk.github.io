The past day has seen significant momentum in **voice AI**, driven by **CES 2026** announcements and a major open-source release. Here's a summary of the most notable developments:

### NVIDIA Launches Nemotron Speech ASR
**NVIDIA** released a new open-source speech-to-text (STT/ASR) model optimized for low-latency applications like real-time voice agents.
- **Key Features:** Cache-aware streaming architecture for stable sub-100ms latency (median 24ms time-to-first-token) and up to 3x higher throughput on GPUs.
- **Performance:** Demos show voice-to-voice agents achieving under 500ms end-to-end latency using NVIDIA's open models (including Nemotron 3 Nano LLM and a preview of Magpie TTS).
- **Availability:** Fully open-source, including weights, data, and code—a massive push toward accessible natural conversational AI.

### Google TV Integrates Gemini Voice Controls
**Google** expanded Gemini on Google TV (starting with TCL models), enhancing the living room experience:
- **Generative Features:** Voice-controlled image/video generation (using Nano Banana and Veo models).
- **Personalization:** Photo remixing from Google Photos and richer AI responses for recommendations or general queries.

### BMW Announces Alexa+ for 2026 iX3
**Amazon's** generative AI-powered **Alexa+** will debut in the **2026 BMW iX3**:
- This marks the first vehicle with this upgraded voice assistant, promising far more natural, context-aware in-car interactions than previous generations.

### Industry Context
Other recent context includes ongoing hype around voice as the "interface of the future," with **OpenAI** reportedly prepping advanced audio models for early 2026. While no major new announcements dropped from players like OpenAI or ElevenLabs in the exact last 24-hour window, CES is significantly amplifying voice tech trends.

Voice AI is rapidly advancing toward seamless, low-latency, multimodal experiences—2026 looks poised for widespread adoption in devices, cars, and agents.
