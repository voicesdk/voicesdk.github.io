## Meet the Editor

Hi! I'm **Saurav Kumar**, a Y Combinator alumnus and Voice AI consultant.

With over a decade of experience, I've helped startups and enterprises build conversational agents, voice-enabled products, and scalable audio AI solutions. I've witnessed the evolution from clunky IVRs to the hyper-realistic agents we see today.

I created *Voice AI Gazette* (now **AI-Speak**) to be a hub for enthusiasts, builders, and leaders interested in the rapid advancements of voice technology.
