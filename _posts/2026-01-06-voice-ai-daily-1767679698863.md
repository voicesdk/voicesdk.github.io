<SUMMARY>
**DeepSeek's New Paper on mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections**
DeepSeek has released a new paper that advances residual-path design as a key scaling lever in neural networks. By constraining residual mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope, they've improved stability and performance with only a 6.7% training overhead. This innovative approach includes systems-level optimizations like fused kernels and activation recomputation, showcasing the integration of math and kernel engineering.

**South Korea's Ministry of Science Launches Sovereign Foundation Models Program**
The South Korean government has launched a program with 5 companies to develop sovereign foundation models from scratch. The initiative features large-scale MoE architectures like SK Telecom A.X-K1 and LG K-EXAONE, with a total first-round budget of $140M. This contrasts with EU approaches by focusing funding on fewer stakeholders and explicitly budgeting for data.
